    <p>Last week I launched <a href="http://plagiarypoets.io">PlagiaryPoets.io</a>, an interactive app that visualizes text reuse within early poetry:</p>

<p>I was inspired to build the app after spending a month studying D3.js with <a href="https://github.com/bobholt">Bob Holt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jugglinmike">Mike Pennisi</a>, and <a href="http://yannickassogba.info/">Yannick Assogba</a>, three brilliant developers who work for <a href="https://bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a>. The site was a lot of fun to build, and I look forward to launching related projects in the months to come. If you have any thoughts about this one, feel free to drop me a line below!</p>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/shakes_characters.css" />

<p>Some time ago, I was intrigued to discover that Shakespeare’s Histories have a noticeable lack of female characters <a href="http://douglasduhaime.com/blog/classifying-shakespearean-drama-with-sparse-feature-sets">[link]</a>. Since then, I’ve been curious to further explore the nuances of Shakespearean characters, paying particular respect to the gender dynamics of the Bard’s plays. This post is a quick sketch of some of the insights to which that curiosity has led.</p>

<p>To get a closer look at Shakespeare’s characters, I ran some analysis on the Folger Shakespeare Library’s gold-standard set of Shakespearean texts <a href="http://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/">[link]</a>, all of which are encoded in fantastic XML markup that captures a number of character-level attributes, including gender. Using that markup, I extracted data for each character in Shakespeare’s plays, and then scoured through those features in search of patterns. All of the characters with an identified gender in this dataset are plotted below (mouseover for character name and source play):</p>

<!-- Words Spoken by Character Entrance Plot -->
<div id="characterWords"></div>
<script src="/js/shakespearean_characters.js"></script>

<p>Looking at this plot, we can see that the most prominent characters in Shakespearean drama are almost all well-known, titular males. There is also a noticeable inverse-relationship between a character’s prominence and the point in the play wherein that character is introduced. Looking more closely at the plot, I’ve further noticed that Shakespeare was curiously consistent in his treatment of characters who appear in multiple plays. In both <i>1 Henry IV</i> and <i>2 Henry IV</i>, for instance, Falstaff is given ~6,000 words and is introduced only a few hundred words into the work. Looking at the long tail, by contrast, one finds that among the outspoken characters introduced after the ~15,000 word mark—including Westmoreland and Bedford in <i>2 Henry IV</i>, and Cade, Clifford, and Iden from <i>2 Henry VI</i>—nearly all hail from Histories.</p>

<p>While the plot above gives one a birds’ eye view of Shakespeare’s characters, the plot doesn’t make it particularly easy to differentiate male and female character dynamics. As a step in this direction, the plot below visualizes character entrances by gender for each of Shakespeare’s plays:</p>

<!-- first and last entrance by gender plot -->
<div id="minMaxEntrance"></div>
<script async="" src="js/min_max_entrances.js"></script>

<p>Examining at the distribution along the x-axis, we can see that male characters consistently enter the stage before female characters. An exception to this general rule may be found in the Comedies, as plays like <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>All’s Well that Ends Well</i>, and <i>Midsummer Nights’ Dream</i> begin with female characters on stage. Looking at the distribution along the y-axis, we can also see that for most plays, male characters continue to be introduced on stage long after the last female characters have been introduced.</p>

<p>Given the plots above, some might conclude that Shakespeare privileged male characters over female characters, as he introduced the former earlier and tended to give them more lines. There is evidence in the plays, however, that points in the opposite direction. Looking at Shakespeare’s minor characters, we see that the smallest and least significant roles in each play were almost universally assigned to males:</p>

<!-- min and max words by gender plot -->
<div id="minMaxWords"></div>
<script async="" src="js/min_max_words.js"></script>

<p>Here we see that even important males characters such as Fleance in <i>Macbeth</i> and Cornelius in <i>Hamlet</i> are given very few lines indeed, and the smallest female roles are consistently given more lines than the smallest male roles.</p>

<p>In sum, the plots above show that a number of heretofore undisclosed patterns emerge when we analyze Shakespeare’s characters in the aggregate. However, the plots above don’t show the connections between characters. One way to investigate these interconnections is through a co-occurrence matrix, in which each cell represents the degree to which two characters appear on stage concurrently:</p>

<p>In this visualization, “Frequency” represents the number of times a character appears on stage, “Gender” is indicated by the markup within the Folger Shakespeare Digital Collection XML (red = female, blue = male, green = unspecified), and “Cluster” reflects the subgroup of characters with whom a given character regularly appears, as determined by a fast greedy modularity ranking algorithm. Interacting with this plot allows one to uncover a number of insights. In the first place, we can see that the Histories consistently feature more “clusters” of characters than do Comedies or Tragedies. That is to say, while Comedies tend to be wildly interconnected affairs, Histories tend to include many small, isolated groups of characters that interact rather little with each other.  Looking at the gender dynamics of these groups, we can also see that in Comedies such as <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> and Histories such as <i>Richard III</i> and <i>Henry V</i>, female characters tend to appear on stage together, almost creating a coherent collective over the course of the play.</p>

<p>Finally, a number of female characters—such as Queen Margaret in <i>2 Henry VI</i> and Adrianna in <i>Comedy of Errors</i>—appear on stage more frequently than any other character in their respective plays, despite the fact that they say fewer words than their respective plays' most outspoken characters. That is to say, their visual presence on stage is disproportionate to their verbal presence on stage. This raises a number of questions: To what extent were female characters meant to fulfill the role of a spectacle in Shakespearean drama? It’s difficult to imagine that the male players who acted as females projected authentic feminine voices. Did the limitations of imitative speech help mitigate the number of lines given to these prominent female characters? These and other questions remain to be explored in future work.</p>

        Clustering Semantic Vectors with Python
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime=September 12, 2015" class="date">September 12, 2015</time>

    <p>Google’s Word2Vec and Stanford’s GloVe have recently offered two fantastic open source software packages capable of transposing words into a high dimension vector space. In both cases, a vector’s position within the high dimensional space gives a good indication of the word’s semantic class (among other things), and in both cases these vector positions can be used in a variety of applications. In the post below, I’ll discuss one approach you can take to clustering the vectors into coherent semantic groupings.</p>

<p>Both Word2Vec and GloVe can create vector spaces given a large training corpus, but both maintain pretrained vectors as well. To get started with ~1GB of pretrained vectors from GloVe, one need only run the following lines:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-shell">wget http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.300d.txt.gz
gunzip glove.6B.300d.txt.gz</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you unzip and then glance at glove.6B.300d.txt, you’ll see that it’s organized as follows:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-shell">the 0.04656 0.21318 -0.0074364 [...] 0.053913
, -0.25539 -0.25723 0.13169 [...] 0.35499
. -0.12559 0.01363 0.10306 [...] 0.13684
of -0.076947 -0.021211 0.21271 [...] -0.046533
to -0.25756 -0.057132 -0.6719 [...] -0.070621
[...]
sandberger 0.429191 -0.296897 0.15011 [...] -0.0590532</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Each new line contains a token followed by 300 signed floats, and those values appear to be organized from most to least common. Given this ready format, it’s fairly straightforward to get straight to clustering!</p>

<p>There are a variety of methods for clustering vectors, including density-based clustering, hierarchical clustering, and centroid clustering. One of the most intuitive and most commonly used centroid-based methods is K-Means. Given a collection of points in a space, K-Means uses a Hunger Games style random lottery to pick a few lucky points (colored green below), then assigns each of the non-lucky points to the lucky point to which it’s closest. Using these preliminary groupings, the next step is to find the “centroid” (or geometric center) of each group, using the same technique one would use to find the center of a square. These centroids become the new lucky points, and again each non-lucky point is again assigned to the lucky point to which it’s closest. This process continues until the centroids settle down and stop moving, after which the clustering is complete. Here’s a nice visual description of K-Means <a href="http://shabal.in/visuals.html">[source]</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/clustering_semantic_vectors/kmeans.gif" id="gif" /></p>

<p>To cluster the GloVe vectors in a similar fashion, one can use the sklearn package in Python, along with a few other packages:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-python">from __future__ import division
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans 
from numbers import Number
from pandas import DataFrame
import sys, codecs, numpy</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It will also be helpful to build a class to mimic the behavior of autovivification in Perl, which is essentially the process of creating new default hash values given a new key. In Python, this behavior is available through collections.defaultdict(), but the latter isn’t serializable, so the following class is handy. Given an input key it hasn’t seen, the class will create an empty list as the corresponding hash value:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-python">class autovivify_list(dict):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;A pickleable version of collections.defaultdict&#39;&#39;&#39;
    def __missing__(self, key):
        &#39;&#39;&#39;Given a missing key, set initial value to an empty list&#39;&#39;&#39;
        value = self[key] = []
        return value

    def __add__(self, x):
        &#39;&#39;&#39;Override addition for numeric types when self is empty&#39;&#39;&#39;
        if not self and isinstance(x, Number):
            return x
        raise ValueError

    def __sub__(self, x):
        &#39;&#39;&#39;Also provide subtraction method&#39;&#39;&#39;
        if not self and isinstance(x, Number):
            return -1 * x
        raise ValueError</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We also want a method to read in a vector file (e.g. glove.6B.300d.txt) and store each word and the position of that word within the vector space. Because reading in and analyzing some of the larger GloVe files can take a long time, to get going quickly one can limit the number of lines to read from the input file by specifying a global value (n_words), which is defined later on:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-python">def build_word_vector_matrix(vector_file, n_words):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Return the vectors and labels for the first n_words in vector file&#39;&#39;&#39;
    numpy_arrays = []
    labels_array = []
    with codecs.open(vector_file, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;utf-8&#39;) as f:
        for c, r in enumerate(f):
            sr = r.split()
            labels_array.append(sr[0])
            numpy_arrays.append( numpy.array([float(i) for i in sr[1:]]) )

            if c == n_words:
                return numpy.array( numpy_arrays ), labels_array

    return numpy.array( numpy_arrays ), labels_array</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Scikit-Learn’s implementation of K-Means returns an object (cluster_labels in these snippets) that indicates the cluster to which each input vector belongs. That object doesn’t tell one which word belongs in each cluster, however, so the following method takes care of this. Because all of the words being analyzed are stored in labels_array and the cluster to which each word belongs is stored in cluster_labels, the following method can easily map those two sequences together:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-python">def find_word_clusters(labels_array, cluster_labels):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Return the set of words in each cluster&#39;&#39;&#39;
    cluster_to_words = autovivify_list()
    for c, i in enumerate(cluster_labels):
        cluster_to_words[ i ].append( labels_array[c] )
    return cluster_to_words</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Finally, we can call the methods above, perform K-Means clustering, and print the contents of each cluster with the following block:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-python">if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    input_vector_file = sys.argv[1] # Vector file input (e.g. glove.6B.300d.txt)
    n_words           = int(sys.argv[2]) # Number of words to analyze 
    reduction_factor  = float(sys.argv[3]) # Amount of dimension reduction {0,1}
    clusters_to_make  = int( n_words * reduction_factor ) # Number of clusters to make
    df, labels_array  = build_word_vector_matrix(input_vector_file, n_words)
    kmeans_model      = KMeans(init=&#39;k-means++&#39;, n_clusters=clusters_to_make, n_init=10)
    kmeans_model.fit(df)

    cluster_labels    = kmeans_model.labels_
    cluster_inertia   = kmeans_model.inertia_
    cluster_to_words  = find_word_clusters(labels_array, cluster_labels)

    for c in cluster_to_words:
        print cluster_to_words[c]
        print &quot;\n&quot;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The full script is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/duhaime/9330473f9a4e288f00af">here</a>. To run it, one needs to specify the vector file to be read in, the number of words one wishes to sample from that file (one can of course read them all, but doing so can take some time), and the “reduction factor”, which determines the number of clusters to be made. If one specifies a reduction factor of .1, for instance, the routine will produce n*.1 clusters, where n is the number of words sampled from the file. The following command reads in the first 10,000 words, and produces 1,000 clusters:</p>

<div>
  <pre data-line=""><code class="language-shell">python cluster_vectors.py glove.6B.300d.txt 10000 .1</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The output of this command is the series of clusters produced by the K-Means clustering:</p>
