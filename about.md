Hi and welcome to my site. I'm a doctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame and the Text and Data Mining Product Manager at ProQuest. I created this site to share some of my working notes, code, and preliminary findings with other researchers, in the hopes that doing so might generate collaborative dialogue. I hope you'll leave a comment or get in touch.
